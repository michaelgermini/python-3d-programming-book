counter = ThreadSafeCounter(0)

def increment_worker(worker_id: int, iterations: int):
    for i in range(iterations):
        value = counter.increment(1)
        if i % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Worker {worker_id}: counter = {value}")

# Create multiple threads
threads = []
for i in range(4):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=increment_worker, args=(i+1, 1000))
    threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

# Wait for all threads to complete
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
```

### Multiprocessing Advanced
```python
# Parallel renderer using multiprocessing
renderer = ParallelRenderer(num_processes=4)

# Render scene in parallel
scene_data = {
    "objects": [{"name": f"object_{i}", "vertex_count": 100} for i in range(20)],
    "camera": {"position": [0, 0, 5], "target": [0, 0, 0]},
    "lights": [{"position": [1, 1, 1], "intensity": 1.0}]
}

render_results = renderer.render_scene_parallel(scene_data)
```

### Asynchronous Programming
```python
# Async renderer for 3D graphics
async def render_scene_async(scene_data):
    renderer = AsyncRenderer()
    await renderer.start_rendering()
    
    # Render scene asynchronously
    results = await renderer.render_scene_async(scene_data)
    
    await renderer.stop_rendering()
    return results

# Run async rendering
asyncio.run(render_scene_async(scene_data))
