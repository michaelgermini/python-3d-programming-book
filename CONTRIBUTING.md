   cd python-3d-programming-book
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install development dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available
   ```

5. **Set up pre-commit hooks** (optional)
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## üìè Style Guidelines
