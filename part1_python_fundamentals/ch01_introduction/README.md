# Chapter 1: Introduction to Python

## Description
Python is a versatile, high-level programming language, ideal for beginners and professionals alike. Its simplicity and readability make it perfect for 3D graphics, data analysis, and automation.

## Key Points
- Easy syntax, readable code
- Supports multiple paradigms (procedural, OOP, functional)
- Large ecosystem of libraries
- Perfect for 3D graphics and scientific computing

## Example Applications
- Automating 3D object placement in a scene
- Processing large sets of object data efficiently
- Creating procedural 3D content
- Data visualization and analysis

## Files in this Chapter
- `hello_world.py` - Basic Python syntax and output
- `3d_object_placement.py` - Example of 3D object manipulation
- `data_processing_example.py` - Processing 3D object data
- `interactive_3d_demo.py` - Interactive 3D scene creation

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand Python's basic syntax and structure
2. Learn how to run Python programs
3. See practical applications in 3D programming
4. Set up your development environment

## Running the Examples
