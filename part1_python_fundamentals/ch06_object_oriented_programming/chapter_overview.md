# Chapter 6: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Description
Object-Oriented Programming is a fundamental paradigm that organizes code into objects containing data and behavior. This chapter covers classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction - all essential concepts for building complex 3D graphics systems. Understanding OOP is crucial for creating maintainable, reusable, and scalable code in graphics programming.

## Key Points
- **Classes and Objects**: Defining classes, creating instances, constructors, and methods
- **Attributes and Methods**: Instance variables, class variables, instance methods, class methods, static methods
- **Inheritance**: Single and multiple inheritance, method overriding, super() function
- **Polymorphism**: Method overriding, duck typing, abstract base classes
- **Encapsulation**: Private attributes, property decorators, getters and setters
- **Abstraction**: Abstract classes, interfaces, hiding implementation details
- **Special Methods**: `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`
- **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Observer, Component patterns for 3D graphics

## Example Applications
- **3D Object Classes**: Creating classes for 3D objects (cubes, spheres, meshes)
- **Scene Management**: Building scene graphs and object hierarchies
- **Component Systems**: Implementing component-based architecture for game objects
- **Material System**: Creating material and shader management classes
- **Animation System**: Building keyframe and animation controller classes
- **Physics Objects**: Creating rigid body and collision detection classes
- **Camera System**: Implementing camera and viewport management classes
- **Event System**: Building event-driven architecture for 3D applications

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Define classes and create objects with appropriate attributes and methods
- Implement inheritance hierarchies for 3D graphics objects
- Use polymorphism to create flexible and extensible code
- Apply encapsulation principles to protect data and control access
- Override special methods to customize object behavior
- Implement common design patterns for 3D graphics applications
- Build component-based systems for complex 3D objects
- Create maintainable and reusable object-oriented code

## Running the Examples
1. Navigate to the chapter directory: `cd part1_python_fundamentals/ch06_object_oriented_programming`
2. Run individual examples: `python basic_classes.py`
3. Run all examples: `python -c "import basic_classes, attributes_methods, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, special_methods, design_patterns, 3d_object_system"`
