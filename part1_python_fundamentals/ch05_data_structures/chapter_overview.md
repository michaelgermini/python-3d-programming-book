# Chapter 5: Data Structures

## Description
Data structures are the foundation of organized data management in Python. This chapter covers lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries - the core data structures that enable efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. Understanding these structures is essential for managing 3D objects, scene hierarchies, and complex data relationships in graphics applications.

## Key Points
- **Lists**: Mutable, ordered sequences for dynamic data
- **Tuples**: Immutable, ordered sequences for fixed data
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value mappings for associative data
- **Data structure selection**: Choosing the right structure for the task
- **Performance characteristics**: Understanding time and space complexity
- **Nested structures**: Combining structures for complex data

## Example Applications
- Managing 3D object collections and hierarchies
- Storing vertex data and mesh information
- Implementing scene graphs and spatial indexing
- Creating configuration systems and settings management
- Building efficient lookup tables and caches

## Files Included
- `chapter_overview.md` - This overview file
- `lists_3d_objects.py` - Lists for managing 3D objects and collections
- `tuples_coordinates.py` - Tuples for immutable coordinate data
- `sets_unique_elements.py` - Sets for unique element management
- `dictionaries_scene_data.py` - Dictionaries for scene and object data
- `nested_structures.py` - Complex nested data structures
- `performance_comparison.py` - Performance analysis of different structures

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Choose appropriate data structures for different scenarios
- Efficiently manage collections of 3D objects and data
- Implement scene graphs and object hierarchies
- Store and retrieve complex data relationships
- Optimize data access patterns for performance
- Create flexible and maintainable data management systems

## Running the Examples
Each example can be run independently:

```bash
# Run individual examples
python lists_3d_objects.py
python tuples_coordinates.py
python sets_unique_elements.py
python dictionaries_scene_data.py
python nested_structures.py
python performance_comparison.py

# Or run all examples from the chapter directory
python -c "import lists_3d_objects, tuples_coordinates, sets_unique_elements, dictionaries_scene_data, nested_structures, performance_comparison"
```

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of Python variables and basic syntax (Chapter 2)
- Familiarity with control flow (Chapter 3)
- Knowledge of functions (Chapter 4)

## Next Steps
After completing this chapter, you'll be ready to explore:
- Object-Oriented Programming (Chapter 6)
- Advanced data processing and algorithms
- Complex 3D scene management systems
- Performance optimization techniques
