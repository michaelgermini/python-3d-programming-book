# Chapter 2: Variables, Data Types, and Operators

## Description
Variables store data in memory; Python supports numbers, strings, booleans, and collections. Operators allow arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.

## Key Points
- Dynamic typing (no need to declare types)
- Basic arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations
- Type conversion and casting for complex calculations
- Variables store coordinates, rotation angles, colors, or object states in 3D scenes

## Example Applications
- Storing coordinates, rotation angles, colors, or object states in a 3D scene
- Performing mathematical calculations for 3D transformations
- Managing object properties and attributes
- Type conversion for different data formats

## Files in this Chapter
- `basic_variables.py` - Basic variable types and operations
- `3d_coordinates.py` - Working with 3D coordinates and vectors
- `object_properties.py` - Managing 3D object properties
- `mathematical_operations.py` - Mathematical operations for 3D graphics
- `type_conversion.py` - Type conversion and casting examples

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand Python's variable system and naming conventions
2. Learn about different data types and their uses
3. Master arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
4. Apply variables and operators to 3D programming scenarios
5. Understand type conversion and when to use it

## Running the Examples
```bash
# Basic variables and data types
python basic_variables.py

# 3D coordinates and vectors
python 3d_coordinates.py

# Object properties management
python object_properties.py

# Mathematical operations
python mathematical_operations.py

# Type conversion examples
python type_conversion.py
```

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Variables**: Creating and using variables to store data
