# Chapter 3: Control Flow (Conditionals and Loops)

## Description
Control flow is the foundation of program logic, allowing you to make decisions and repeat actions. This chapter covers conditional statements (if/elif/else) and loops (for/while), which are essential for creating interactive 3D applications, game logic, and data processing.

## Key Points
- **Conditional Statements**: if, elif, else statements for decision making
- **Comparison Operators**: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=, in, not in
- **Logical Operators**: and, or, not for complex conditions
- **Loops**: for loops for iteration, while loops for conditional repetition
- **Loop Control**: break, continue, else clauses
- **Nested Control Structures**: Combining conditionals and loops

## Example Applications
- **3D Scene Management**: Conditionally rendering objects based on visibility, distance, or user settings
- **Game Logic**: Implementing player movement, collision detection, and game state management
- **Data Processing**: Filtering and transforming 3D object data based on various criteria
- **Animation Systems**: Creating smooth transitions and complex animation sequences

## Files Included
- `chapter_overview.md` - This overview file
- `basic_conditionals.py` - Basic if/elif/else statements with 3D examples
- `complex_conditions.py` - Logical operators and complex conditional logic
- `for_loops.py` - For loops for iteration over sequences and ranges

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
1. Write conditional statements to make decisions in your code
2. Use comparison and logical operators to create complex conditions
3. Implement for loops to iterate over data structures and ranges
4. Use while loops for conditional repetition
5. Combine conditionals and loops to create complex program logic
6. Apply control flow concepts to 3D graphics and game development

## Running the Examples
Each example can be run independently:

```bash
# Run basic conditionals example
python basic_conditionals.py
