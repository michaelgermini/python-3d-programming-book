# Chapter 19: Scene Graphs and Object Hierarchies

## Overview
This chapter covers scene graphs and object hierarchies, which are fundamental to organizing and managing complex 3D scenes. Scene graphs provide a hierarchical structure for representing objects, their relationships, and spatial organization in 3D applications.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand scene graph structure and node types
- Implement spatial partitioning and culling techniques
- Master scene management and optimization
- Learn performance monitoring and profiling
- Apply scene serialization and loading

## Core Concepts

### 1. Scene Graph Structure
- **Node hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships between objects
- **Node types**: Group, geometry, light, camera, and transform nodes
- **Scene traversal**: Efficient navigation through the scene graph
- **Bounding boxes**: Spatial bounds for objects and groups

### 2. Spatial Organization
- **Octree partitioning**: 3D spatial subdivision for efficient queries
- **Frustum culling**: Visibility testing against camera view frustum
- **Level-of-detail**: Distance-based detail reduction
- **Spatial queries**: Finding objects in specific regions

### 3. Scene Management
- **Scene serialization**: Saving and loading scene data
- **Performance optimization**: Scene-level optimizations
- **Statistics tracking**: Monitoring scene performance
- **Memory management**: Efficient resource handling

## Mathematical Foundations

### Bounding Box Calculations
Axis-aligned bounding boxes provide efficient spatial bounds:
```
Center = (min + max) / 2
Size = max - min
Radius = |size| / 2
```

### Octree Subdivision
Octree divides 3D space into 8 octants recursively:
```
For each octant i:
  center_i = parent_center ± size/4
  bounds_i = BoundingBox(center_i - size/2, center_i + size/2)
```

### Frustum Culling
Frustum planes are extracted from view-projection matrix:
```
Plane = (normal, distance)
Visibility = point · normal + distance ≥ 0
```
