# Chapter 17: Camera and Projection Concepts

## Overview
This chapter covers the fundamental concepts of cameras and projection systems in 3D graphics. Understanding how cameras work and how to implement different projection types is essential for creating realistic 3D scenes and interactive applications.

## Key Learning Objectives

### 2. Projection Systems
- **Perspective projection**: Realistic depth perception
- **Orthographic projection**: Parallel lines for technical applications

- **Projection matrix**: Converting 3D coordinates to 2D screen space

### 3. Camera Controls
- **Input handling**: Processing keyboard, mouse, and gamepad input
- **Smooth movement**: Interpolation and easing for natural camera motion
- **Constraints**: Limiting camera movement and rotation

## Mathematical Foundations

### View Matrix
The view matrix transforms world coordinates to view coordinates:
```
View = [R_x  R_y  R_z  -P]
       [0    0    0    1 ]
```
Where R_x, R_y, R_z are the camera's right, up, and forward vectors, and P is the camera position.

### Perspective Projection
The perspective projection matrix:
```
P = [f/aspect  0    0                   0              ]
    [0         f    0                   0              ]
    [0         0    (far+near)/(n-f)   2fn/(n-f)      ]
    [0         0    -1                  0              ]
```
Where f = 1/tan(fov/2), aspect is width/height, and n/f are near/far planes.

### Orthographic Projection
The orthographic projection matrix:
```
O = [2/(r-l)   0         0         -(r+l)/(r-l)]
    [0         2/(t-b)   0         -(t+b)/(t-b)]
    [0         0         -2/(f-n)  -(f+n)/(f-n)]
    [0         0         0         1            ]
```
