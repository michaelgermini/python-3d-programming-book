# Chapter 18: Transformations

## Overview
This chapter covers 3D transformations, which are fundamental to positioning, orienting, and scaling objects in 3D space. Understanding transformations is essential for creating dynamic 3D scenes, animations, and interactive applications.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand transformation matrices and their components
- Master translation, rotation, and scaling operations
- Learn about transformation hierarchies and parent-child relationships
- Implement coordinate system transformations
- Apply transformations for 3D graphics applications

## Core Concepts

### 1. Transformation Matrices
- **Translation matrices**: Moving objects in 3D space
- **Rotation matrices**: Rotating objects around axes
- **Scaling matrices**: Changing object size
- **Matrix composition**: Combining multiple transformations
- **Matrix decomposition**: Extracting transformation components

### 2. Transformation Hierarchies
- **Parent-child relationships**: Objects inheriting transformations
- **Local vs world space**: Understanding coordinate spaces
- **Transformation inheritance**: How child objects follow parent movements
- **Hierarchical animation**: Animating complex object structures

### 3. Coordinate Systems
- **Multiple coordinate spaces**: World, object, camera, and local spaces
- **Coordinate transformations**: Converting between different spaces
- **View matrices**: Camera coordinate system transformations
- **Coordinate system management**: Managing multiple coordinate systems

- `ObjectCoordinateSystem` for object-specific coordinates

## Mathematical Foundations

### Transformation Matrix
A 4x4 transformation matrix combines translation, rotation, and scaling:
```
T = [R_x  R_y  R_z  P]
    [0    0    0    1]
```
Where R_x, R_y, R_z are the rotation/scale components, and P is the translation.

### Matrix Composition
Transformations are combined by matrix multiplication:
```
Final = T1 * T2 * T3
```
The order matters: translation * rotation * scale is typical.

### Coordinate Transformation
To transform a point from coordinate system A to B:
```
P_B = M_B * M_A^(-1) * P_A
```
Where M_A and M_B are the transformation matrices of the respective systems.
