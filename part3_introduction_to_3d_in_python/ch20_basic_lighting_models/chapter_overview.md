# Chapter 20: Basic Lighting Models

## Overview
This chapter covers basic lighting models and techniques for 3D graphics. Lighting is essential for creating realistic and visually appealing 3D scenes, providing depth, atmosphere, and visual cues about object properties and spatial relationships.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand fundamental lighting models (ambient, diffuse, specular)
- Implement different light types (directional, point, spot)
- Master shading techniques (flat, Gouraud, Phong)
- Apply lighting optimization for real-time rendering
- Calculate surface normals and lighting interactions

## Core Concepts

### 1. Lighting Models
- **Ambient lighting**: Global illumination that affects all surfaces equally
- **Diffuse lighting**: Directional lighting that varies with surface orientation
- **Specular lighting**: Reflective highlights that depend on view direction
- **Material properties**: Surface reflectance characteristics
- **Light attenuation**: Distance-based light intensity reduction

### 2. Light Types
- **Directional lights**: Infinite distance lights (like the sun)
- **Point lights**: Omni-directional lights with distance attenuation
- **Spot lights**: Directional lights with angular falloff
- **Area lights**: Extended light sources for soft shadows

### 3. Shading Techniques
- **Flat shading**: One color per polygon face
- **Gouraud shading**: Interpolated colors from vertices
- **Phong shading**: Interpolated normals with per-fragment lighting
- **Normal interpolation**: Smooth surface normal calculation

### 4. Lighting Optimization
- **Light culling**: Removing irrelevant lights from calculations
- **Light clustering**: Spatial organization of lights
- **Level-of-detail**: Distance-based light quality reduction
- **Batch processing**: Efficient multiple point lighting

## Mathematical Foundations

### Lighting Equation
The basic lighting equation combines multiple components:
```
Final Color = Emission + Ambient + Σ(Diffuse + Specular) * Attenuation
```

### Diffuse Lighting
Diffuse reflection follows Lambert's cosine law:
```
Diffuse = Light_Color × Material_Diffuse × max(0, N · L)
```

### Specular Lighting
Specular highlights use the Phong reflection model:
```
Specular = Light_Color × Material_Specular × max(0, V · R)^Shininess
```

### Light Attenuation
Point light attenuation follows inverse square law:
```
Attenuation = 1 / (Constant + Linear×Distance + Quadratic×Distance²)
```

### Barycentric Coordinates
Triangle interpolation uses barycentric coordinates:
```
P = u×V₀ + v×V₁ + w×V₂
where u + v + w = 1
```
